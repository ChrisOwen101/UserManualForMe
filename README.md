# User Manual For Chris Owen
## A User Manual for working with me.

## Conditions I like to work in
I mostly work with headphones listening to [house](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZZHMHTHR1uH1eHYnM5wXv?si=M5d3ZDcLQ5qFIekvTZwXAA)/[techno](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/527OLqNKEXYOYHQ5OlwNAq?si=tsAVNJyFSPGhgHsHRlNyjw) if I'm coding or [this piano playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4sWSpwq3LiO) if I'm writing. 

I'm pretty happy working anywhere but actually prefer a busy office or coffee shop to complete silence. 

## The times/hours I like to work
I hate mornings and I'd always prefer to have a meeting in the afternoon. 

I'm a bit of a night owl so you'll often find me coding late into the night we I can get into a flow. 

## The best ways to communicate with me
Slack is the quickest way to get a response from me. Please don't hesitate to reach out at any time, as I'll put the phone on silent if I'm busy, and am always happy to help a colleague out of hours. I find the idea of you being blocked on something that I could be helping with more disturbing than the idea of being asked for thing out of hours.

I don't like answering my phone, as I'm often in spaces which are either too noisy for that or so quiet that my conversation would be forced on those around me. I do read texts though, so SMS or WhatsApp are cool.

I stay on top of my emails daily, so for anything non-urgent, feel confident that your email will get a reply within a workday or so.

If we're in person, I'm always happy to be interupted and I'll tell you if now isn't a good time. 

## The ways I like to receive feedback
The only way I respond well to feedback is by positioning us against the problem rather you against me. We're always working towards the same goal! I'm completely fine with constructive feedback in the form of "Have you thought of..." rather than "This is bad and should be re-written...".

I consider all feedback a learning opportunity, and do my very best not to get defensive. It can sometimes take me a moment to process feedback and return 

Face to face is ideal, in lieu of that a video call and if that's hard, then a phone call.

## Things I need
<!--I'm something of an optimist-->

<!--Clarity and over communication. I have a hard time following through on tasks when I don't understand why we're doing them, and so I crave involvement in as many conversations as possible and as much background information as possible before delving into a task.-->

<!--This is predominantly because I like to know that I'm solving the right problem, rather than a perceived one or a symptom.-->

## Things I struggle with
I'm an introverted extrovert (although I don't put much stock in that kind of classification) which means that I take a while to warm up to people but generally "recharge" by interacting with people. If I seem quite, it's not being I don't like you! It just takes me a while. 

<!--If I don't understand the wider purpose behind why we are doing something, I find it hard to engage with it.-->

<!--I dislike Gatekeeping, and will always prefer to incur some discomfort by letting it through the gate, whenever it is something that can be addressed at a later point. This is true for hiring (They seem like a positive fit but lack something that we need? Lets bring them in and empower them to fill the gaps) and is equally true for the ways in which we work (How often have you heard the phrase "That's how we've always done it"? Lets try new ideas and iterate on them instead of just saying "No!").-->

## Things I love
<!--I love collaborating on things, be it brain storming sessions, pair programming or random conversations about things.-->

<!--I like hearing about other people's challenges, it helps me get comfortable with my own, and gives me opportunities to share my own experience and ideas.-->

<!--I love teaching, mentor individuals outside of the workplace, and am always open to taking on new mentees (time permitted).-->

## Other things to know about me
<!--I bring my whole self to work, always, and am extremely uncomfortable when I can't do so.-->
