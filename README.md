# User Manual For Chris Owen
## A User Manual for working with me.

## Conditions I like to work in
I'm pretty happy working anywhere but actually prefer a busy office or coffee shop to complete silence. I quite like quiet background music in an office. 

I mostly work with headphones listening to [house](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZZHMHTHR1uH1eHYnM5wXv?si=M5d3ZDcLQ5qFIekvTZwXAA)/[techno](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/527OLqNKEXYOYHQ5OlwNAq?si=tsAVNJyFSPGhgHsHRlNyjw) if I'm coding or [this piano playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4sWSpwq3LiO) if I'm writing. 

## The times/hours I like to work
I hate mornings and I'd always prefer to do work in the afternoon. I'm a bit of a night owl so you'll often find me coding late into the night when I get into a flow. 

Flexible working hours are very important to me. 

## The best ways to communicate with me
Slack is the quickest way to get a response from me. Please don't hesitate to reach out at any time, as I'll put the phone on silent if I'm busy, and am always happy to help a colleague out of hours. I find the idea of you being blocked on something that I could be helping with more disturbing than the idea of being asked for thing out of hours.

Phone calls are fine but I'd rather we book in a slot and then chat unless it's really urgent so I can plan a little first. I find asynchronous communication much less stressful.

I stay on top of my emails daily, so for anything non-urgent, feel confident that your email will get a reply within a workday or so.

If we're in person, I'm always happy to be interrupted and I'll tell you if now isn't a good time. 

## The ways I like to receive feedback
The only way I respond well to feedback is by positioning us against the problem rather you against me. We're always working towards the same goal! I'm completely fine with constructive feedback in the form of "Have you thought of..." rather than "This is bad and should be re-written...".

I consider all feedback a learning opportunity, and do my very best not to get defensive. It can sometimes take me a moment to process feedback and return with a fresh mind however. 

Face to face is best, in lieu of that a video call and if that's hard, then a phone call.

## Things I need
I'm something of an optimist and find it hard when other people are overly pessimistic. I'd rather plan for the best case and then actively manage the worst rather than the other way around. 

Other than that, I think I'm a very easy going person to live with!

## Things I struggle with
I'm an introverted extrovert (although I don't put much stock in that kind of classification) which means that I take a while to warm up to people but generally "recharge" by interacting with people. If I seem quiet, it's not being I don't like you! It just takes me a while. 

I'm a tad dyslexic which means that while I love writing (and I think I'm alright at it) what I write may not quite make sense or words might be spelt wrong. I'll never take offence at a correction! If I'm copying something down I'd nearly always prefer you send it to me in a Slack message. 

When I'm very stressed I'm quite susceptible to [depersonalisation](http://discoverthought.com/Burnout/Depersonalization.html) as a coping mechanism. It’s obviously something I try to manage but if I’m short with you, that means I’m struggling. 

## Things I love
I love collaborating on things, be it brainstorming sessions, pair programming or random conversations about things. I love the process of generating ideas and working on problems together.

I find one-on-one teaching or mentoring deeply fulfilling and rewarding. The feeling of having somebody go from not understanding something to understanding is fantastic. 

## Other things to know about me
I'm also really into ecology, the climate crisis and how technology can help solve these challenges. Chat to me about it!

Over the past few years I've lived in London, Athens, Cape Town, Berlin and Lisbon. Currently I live in a warehouse with 11 housemates. 

I've listened to over 71 days of podcasts over the past five years.
